            <strong>The short version:</strong> SubTrackr stores everything on your device and nothing anywhere else. We don't know who you are, what subscriptions you have, or how much you spend. That's the whole point.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 19, 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr ("the App") is a subscription tracking application. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.</p>

        <h2>Developer Information</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr is developed and maintained by Praneeth ("Developer/We/Us").</p>
        <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:subtrackr.app@gmail.com">subtrackr.app@gmail.com</a></p>

        <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Financial data (bank accounts, credit cards, account numbers)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
            <li>Cookies or tracking pixels</li>
            <li>Any data entered into the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>All data you enter into SubTrackr — including subscription names, costs, renewal dates, categories, and notes — is stored exclusively on your device using a local database (SQLite). This data never leaves your device. There is no server, no cloud sync, and no remote database.</p>
        <p>If you delete the App, your data is permanently deleted with it.</p>

        <h2>No Account Required</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or log in with any service. The App is fully functional without any personal information.</p>

        <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr does not integrate with or transmit data to any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics</li>
            <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
            <li>Facebook SDK</li>
            <li>Advertising networks</li>
            <li>Crash reporting services that collect personal data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr offers an optional one-time in-app purchase to unlock premium features. This transaction is processed entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). We do not receive, store, or have access to your payment information. Your purchase is governed by Apple's or Google's respective privacy policies and terms of service.</p>

        <h2>Local Notifications</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr may send you local push notifications to remind you of upcoming subscription renewals, but only if you grant notification permission. These notifications are generated and delivered entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any external server.</p>

        <h2>Data Export</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr allows you to export your subscription data as a CSV file. This export is generated locally on your device. What you do with the exported file is your responsibility. We recommend handling exported data with care, as it may contain information about your subscriptions and spending.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since the App collects no data, it is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.</p>

        <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr does not sell personal information. SubTrackr does not collect personal information. California residents have the same experience as all other users: complete data privacy with no collection, storage, or sharing of personal data.</p>

        <h2>European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>SubTrackr does not process personal data as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). No data is collected, no data is transmitted, and no data is stored on any server. All data remains on your device under your sole control.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, correct, delete, or port. Your data exists only on your device, and you have full control over it at all times.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.</p>
